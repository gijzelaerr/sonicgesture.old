Sonic Gesture is a Computer Vision project where learned hand
gestures and/or poses are translated into a corresponding
command with the aim of generating sound. In other words this
software makes it possible to create and manipulating sound
without physical interaction with a computer.

This is the graduation project of Gijs Molenaar for the Master
Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam.

NOTE: The current state of the code is a little bit a mess. When
I have time I will clean up stuff.
