Description: Stranslating gestures into sound using computer vision
 Sonic Gesture is a Computer Vision project where learned hand gestures
 and/or poses are translated into a corresponding command with the aim of
 generating sound. In other words this software makes it possible to create
 and manipulating sound without physical interaction with a computer.
 .
 This is the graduation project of Gijs Molenaar for the Master Artificial
 Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam.
